/**
 * Screen-reader live announcer.
 *
 * Messages are queued and drained one at a time with a small gap between
 * each, which gives the screen reader enough of a DOM-mutation signal to
 * pick up each announcement separately. The previous setTimeout-clear-
 * then-set pattern dropped the first message whenever a second announce()
 * ran within ~100ms (M8 in walkthrough_findings_2026-04-25.md). Concrete
 * example of the dropped case: a user expands a scene block, which fires
 * `announce("Opened scene 1...")`; meanwhile the granularity selector
 * happens to fire `announce("Detail level changed to Detailed")` because
 * a parent-driven re-render commits in the same frame. With the old
 * implementation the user heard only the second; with the queue both
 * announcements are read.
 *
 * The element itself sets `role="status" aria-live="polite"
 * aria-atomic="true"` in App.jsx; this module only manages the text
 * content.
